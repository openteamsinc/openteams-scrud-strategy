# OpenTeams SCRUD Strategy Document

[Documentation](https://openteamsinc.github.io/openteams-scrud-strategy/)

This project contains a Sphinx project detailing a SCRUD (Semantic
Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete) strategy for OpenTeams development and the components
that we'll need to develop to support it. The implementation of the OpenTeams SCRUD
strategy will be a family of open source projects for both the supporting REST services
and the browser client.
