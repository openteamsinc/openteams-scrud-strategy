SCRUD (Semantic Create Retrive Update and Delete)
=================================================

`SCRUD <https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/semantic-http-spec>`_ defines a set of
standards for HTTP REST APIs. These standards make resources and services very
discoverable by requiring specific support for the HTTP OPTIONS method as well as
standard headers required for compliant APIs.

The result of the SCRUD standards is a base REST architecture intended to provide a rich
foundation for access control and automated UI binding.
