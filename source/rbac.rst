Attribute and Role-Based Access Control
=======================================

For access control OpenTeams will use the django-scoped-rbac project. This project
provides a flexible framework for defining access control policies using the same REST
architecture proposed for OpenTeams.

For nuxt, the scoped-rbac package in NPM will be used to inform UI disclosure based on
authorization.
