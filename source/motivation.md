# Motivation

In the coming months, OpenTeams is likely to grow rapidly in the number of supported
Clients and Partners. As we grow, we'll need to rapidly implement web services and
supporting user interfaces. We need to be prepared to move quickly and adjust our
designs and implementations quickly as we discover the requirements.

This document will detail an architecture intended to help us move as quickly as
possible while setting the stage for more advanced capability. The goal is to make the
definition of new web services as trivial as defining a {ref}`JSON-Schema` and
{ref}`JSON-LD` context for the desired web services, with basic CRUD support coming for
free and basic UI rendering coming for free as well.

## Proposal

Let's use the resources we have today to build this architecture in July so we can ramp
up development in August with minimal resources needed. Let's also lay an open source
foundation that both OpenTeams and our Elite Partner Quansight can build on.
